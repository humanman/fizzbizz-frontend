# FizzBizz React App with custom API built in AWS with Python

- Currently running in development
## What is this project about?


- This is a full stack app built in under 7 days.
- This is a single day booking app that imagines a scenario of 2 companies sharing meeting rooms.

  - users log in with their Ethereum wallet using the [https://metamask.io/](MetaMask) browser extension

  - User chooses their company (COKE or PEPSI) then enters their name
  - Once on the user successfully logs in, they will see a simple dashboard, which allows them to book rooms (10 for each company) by the hour.
  - Users can create or delete a booking
  - Users may not delete other bookings
  - Since this is in development, the user id which is locked to their web3 public address has been unhooked for demo purposes. This allows users to "log in" with different usernames to test out features.

  - As of this writing there are still many things to tweak, but the core purpose of this experiment was to dive into the deep end of technologies I haven't used much (React and Python) to see what I can do in a limited amount of time.

  - I will be cleaning up and enhancing now that I have the time to sit and read through the documentation a bit more - especially blockchain decetralized identity (blockchain is the future!)

  - Check out the backend I created during this mini sprint over at [https://github.com/humanman/fizzbizz-backend](FizzBizz Back End)
